    "abstract": "This invention relates to the composition for waterproofing concrete and aggregate and for improving the bonding and strength of aggregate. The composition is largely composed of an aqueous solution of calcium chloride, CaCl2, and water in the approximate proportions of 1:4, admixed with an aluminum sulphate, Al2(SO4)3 .18H2O water solution, a copper II sulphate CuSO4 .5H2O and water solution, and a caustic potash KOH, and water solution admixed with the aforesaid calcium chloride solution in the order mentioned. The total proportion is approximately calcium chloride, CaCl2, 20 percent, aluminum sulphate, Al2(SO4)3.18H2O, 1.2 percent copper II sulphate, CuSO4 .5H2O, 0.6 percent, caustic potash KOH, 1.0 percent and the remainder about 78 percent water. The commercial flake calcium chloride contains from approximately 77 percent to approximately 80 percent calcium chloride, the balance being largely water of crystallization. This calcium chloride also contains approximately 0.5 percent sodium chromate Na2CrO4. The flake calcium chloride also contains about 0.1 percent calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (which gives slight alkalinity to the chromate treated calcium chloride solution). The flake calcium chloride also contains a maximum of 2 percent sodium chloride NaCl and much less than 0.5 percent magnesium chloride MgCl2.",

The method includes preparing a copper or silver melt by adding, to the copper or silver, stoichiometric amounts of boron and zirconium whereby the stoichiometric amounts comprise additions of 0.3 to 0.6 weight percent of zirconium and 0.1 to 0.2 weight percent of boron, resulting in a fine dispersion melt of less than 1 volume percent of ZrB 2  in the copper or silver. Subsequently, the fine dispersion melt is processed into semifinished products using continuous casting units or continuous rolling units. The semifinished products and the said structural components made therefrom exhibit a combination of a high electrical conductivity from over 95 up to 99 percent IACS, a high softening temperature of at least 600\u00c2\u00b0 C., high tensile strength at 800\u00c2\u00b0 C. (in the range of 120 N/mm 2 ), an excellent formability and a resistance to atmospheres containing pollutants, such as, H 2  S and NaCl. Excess calcium hexaboride, CaB 6  can be used as a deoxidant, such that the excess serves for introducing the necessary boron proportion into the copper or silver melt. Silver alloys are produced which are tarnish-resistant in a sulfur-containing environment.",

    "title": "Method for the cultivation of microorganisms of the genus thraustochytriales by using an optimized low salt medium",
    "abstract": "The invention relates to an optimized method for cultivating microorganisms of the genus  Thraustochytriales , according to which the microorganisms are cultivated in a low salt medium without adding sodium salts and chloride salts, the total salt content being less than 3.5 g/L (corresponding to less than 10 percent of sea water salt content), whereupon the PUFAs are isolated from the microorganisms and/or the medium. The invention especially relates to novel optimized media having a substantially reduced total salt content, above all a particularly reduced NaCl content. The production of PUFAs can be substantially improved and significantly simplified by using a novel combination of different salts as a media composition in which the overall weight ratios of ions do not exceed 1.75 g/L. Furthermore, said medium preferably contains no added sodium salt and chloride salt at all, which helps prevent environmental damages caused by wastewaters containing salt.",
